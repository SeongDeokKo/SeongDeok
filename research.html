        This paper studies short-term return reversals implied by the mismatch between
        characteristic-predicted return ranks and realized return ranks. A long–short strategy
        exploiting large decile-level divergences earns strong gross returns, but profitability
        is concentrated in small, illiquid, high-volatility stocks where transaction costs
        meaningfully limit implementability. A within-industry peer-based refinement improves
        net performance by filtering noise and targeting more comparable firms.

      <p>
        Using BOJ ETF purchases as a natural experiment,
        the paper shows that when interventions are predictable, trading volume in Nikkei 225 futures
        spikes during the lunch break—when the cash market is closed—while prices remain stable.
        The effect appears across both :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} and
        :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} listings, consistent with
        cross-market transmission. Overall, anticipated policy support is absorbed mainly through
        execution and liquidity behavior rather than immediate price adjustment.
